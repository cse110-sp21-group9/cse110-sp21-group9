# Planning Phase Delegation
Status: Completed

Deciders: Alan, Daisuke, Edward, Etienne, Evan, Elisa, Kenny

Date: 4/21/2021 @ 4PM

## Need to decide who should do what to plan out the bullet journal
- We were tasked with creating a bullet journal but we didn't know what we wanted from one
- We also wanted to figure out how our bullet journal would look like

## Decision Outcome
- Each member comes up with at least one user story by the next meeting
- Each member comes up with a wireframe
- Each person comes up with a feature proposal
- Evan and Elisa come up with a wireframe
- Edward and Alan will be in charge of taking notes and research
- Kenny, Daisuke, and Etienne will be in charge of research and lead the project pitch
- Edmund will take a break

## Reasoning
- Edmund had gotten into an emergency. 
- Evan and Elisa had made it known they drew and designed things as a hobby. 
- Kenny, Daisuke, and Etienne had showed up to the meeting where we decided this delegation with a fair bit of research on hand. 
- Edward and Alan were quite reliable when it came to notetaking during the group bonding meeting.
- Group needed a bunch of core features to think about implementing fast.
- Group needed to give a wireframe for the project pitch
- Group also needed to think about who we were trying to create the bujo for.
