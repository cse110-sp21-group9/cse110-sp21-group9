## We needed to figure out who was best suited for which job out of a list of several.
- We needed the following positions:
  - Front End Lead
  - Back End Lead
  - Designer
  - Developer
  - Pipeline Person
  - Unit Tester

## Decision Outcome
- We first filled out a survey asking us our knowledge in each department and our willingness to take on the responsibilities of such a department
- The results were as follows:
  - Front End Lead: Kenny
  - Back End Lead: Edmund
  - Designer: Elisa
  - Developer: Daisuke, Etienne, Evan
  - Pipeline: Alan
  - Unit Tester: Edward

## Reasoning
- Edmund and Kenny had more experience with their respective ends.
- It was agreed Elisa had the most aesthetic sense within the group based on her wireframe. 
- Daisuke, Etienne, and Evan made clear their experience was limited and so were happy to be told what to do.
- Edward and Alan volunteered for their respective positions.
